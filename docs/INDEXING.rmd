We should be able to search for a hotkey in a specific application by tags, text and keys themselves.

See [sampleconfig.yaml](../static/sampleconfig.yaml) for how a hotkey list might look

1. Config files should have separate indexes.
2. We should index tags and descriptions (split into words).
3. We should index the associated keys.

**But is indexing really necessary?**

I'm omitting indexing for now. Will return to this if the necessity shows.
