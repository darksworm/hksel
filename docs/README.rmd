### The problem
There are too many hotkeys to remember. When learning a new tool hands-on in a work setting usually leads to the use of inefficient action paths due to frustrations (deadlines, online-only manuals, etc.)

### The solution
A tool that stores, displays and helps you locate the specific hotkey you need, with a keyboard-only navigateable UI, to avoid breaking your flow.

### The workflow
1. Open the hotkey selection tool (probably bound to a hotkey itself)
	a) Start pressing key combinations to filter the available hotkeys
	b) Use vim-like (/) search to filter hotkeys
	(a and b can be used in tandom)
2. Find and select the necessary hotkey
3. Press return to execute the selected hotkey

### The mockup
A full-screen overlay, that captures all keyboard input.

#### The initial view
![The initial view](img/initial_view.png)

Place for:

1. basic usage instructions / *customizable text*?
2. *pinned* hotkeys?
3. most commonly used *categories*?

#### Filtering by keys

##### Ordering:

a) ~~Order by usage count (most common first)?~~
b) Order by relevancy to last focused app?
c) **Order alphabetically for consistency?**

##### Comments:
Should probably be scrollable.
Should it be mouse friendly? Probably not.
Use vim-like navigation: h,j,k,l,$,^

#### Searching by tags and filtering by keys

How to switch from the `/` search input to filtering by keys and vice versa? Should probably be some kind of toggle. Maybe draw inspo from vim: multiple different modes, but preferably with the same key to switch between them.

##### 3 modes:

a) `/` tag search mode
b) filtering by associated keys
c) results navigation mode
